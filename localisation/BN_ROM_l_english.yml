 ### Events
 rom.1.t:0 "Woes of the Coalition"
 rom.1.desc:0 "Another day, another shouting match in the cabinet meeting room. Since this economic crisis started our allies in red and brown have been at each others throat about what to do. Not really 'friends' before, this political alliance is deteriorating by the second. We hope we can keep this unholy alliance until elections, but these Romans don't seem to see each other as brothers in arms anymore."

 rom.2.t:0 "The Demonstrators Advance"
 rom.2.desc:0 "The demonstrators were allowed peacefully into the capital and minimum violence. President Parri greeted some of the leaders in his private office, getting from them assurances that they will not incite violence, while the police stayed at their headquarters. The syndicates were able to exert pressure for higher wages, lower working hours and more relief in this time of crisis. The next morning in the assembly, La Malfa was able to parlay this pressure into more will to pass legislation, whether to curb the crisis or the protesters, we aren't quite sure yet.\n\n Meanwhile the conservative and right wing press are having a field day. Accusing the Government of leaving the streets to 'vandals, ruffians and delinquents', trading the safety of the Nation because we are too much of a chicken to fight against the 5th column. They have started to ask their readers to counter protest, and oppose the government."

 rom.3.t:0 "The Demonstrators Retreat"
 rom.3.desc:0 "With the police out in force, "
