 # Starting Situation
 ROM_BISMARCKS_NIGHTMARE_DESC:0 "When the conservative Kingdom of Italy surrendered at the end of The Great War, radical republicans in Rome seized the moment to declare a new Roman Republic, unshackled from the tyranny of the monarchy and its appeal to "Italianness". Since then, the Republic has been an unstable mess of factions, with the radical government steadily losing support. In the last election the radical liberals were forced to enter an alliance with the Partito Socialista Romano and the Fascio d'Azione Rivoluzionaria, a fringe movement of the italian left that has incorporated elements of nationalism and interventionism."

 ### Ideas
 ROM_idea_depression_0:0 "Great Depression"
 ROM_idea_depression_0_desc:0 "During the second semester of 1935, the US and French economies started to slow down. The massive expansion of the economy in the 1920's has lead to overborrowing and overexposure for the banks. In the US in 1935 the banks started to default, and the crisis spiraled from there to the rest of the world.\nThe Roman Republic has been less affected due to low international trade, but the crisis still lingers."

 ROM_idea_rampant_militarism_desc:0 "Since the loss of the territories in the north due to the Great War, nationalists and politicians blame the traitors of Democrazia Cristiana and PLI, who advocated for lower investment in the army and peace. As a result, the government has ramped up the worship of the military and amped up the 'stabbed in the back' narrative."

While during a time this was considered uninmportant and fairly small, the reports have not stopped. The total missing equipment has now surpassed what is expected of normal military corruption and graft. The government has decided to create an intelligence agency to monitor ands to handle its more 'sensitive' issues and use this investigation as its first big test."

 ### Events
 rom.1.t:0 "Woes of the Coalition"
 rom.1.desc:0 "Another day, another shouting match in the cabinet meeting room. Since this economic crisis started our allies in red and brown have been at each others throat about what to do. Not really 'friends' before, this political alliance is deteriorating by the second. We hope we can keep this unholy alliance until elections, but these Romans don't seem to see each other as brothers in arms anymore."
 rom.1.a:0 "At least it wasn't a fist fight this time"
 rom.2.t:0 "The Demonstrators Advance"
 rom.2.desc:0 "The demonstrators were allowed peacefully into the capital and minimum violence. President Parri greeted some of the leaders in his private office, getting from them assurances that they will not incite violence, while the police stayed at their headquarters. The syndicates were able to exert pressure for higher wages, lower working hours and more relief in this time of crisis. The next morning in the assembly, La Malfa was able to parlay this pressure into more will to pass legislation, whether to curb the crisis or the protesters, we aren't quite sure yet.\n\n Meanwhile the conservative and right wing press are having a field day. Accusing the Government of leaving the streets to 'vandals, ruffians and delinquents', trading the safety of the Nation because we are too much of a chicken to fight against the 5th column. They have started to ask their readers to counter protest, and oppose the government."

 rom.20.t:0 "The Smyrna Situation"
 rom.20.desc:0 "Eugenia Chiesa was sitting at his desk, collecting his notes from the last cabinet meeting, when there was a knock on the door. An aide came into the room, looking like he had run. He held in his hand a paper, a communique brought from the foreign ministry. He looked shook. "What's going on?", asked Chiesa. The aide stammered "... this, this is for you sir", and handed him the paper. On the note it said:\n\nPARAMALITARY ATTACK ON SMYRNA. INIGO CAMPIONI KIA. THIS IS NO DRILL."
