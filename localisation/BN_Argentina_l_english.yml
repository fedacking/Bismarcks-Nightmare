ARG_trials_of_the_pan_desc:0 "The Partido Autonomista Nacional were the enforcers of the King's policy. They had helped the King in doing most of his excesses and atrocities.

#Congo
arg.1.t:0 "The Status of the Congo"

arg.1.a:0 "Sell it, we need the money now!"
arg.1.b:0 "Keep it! It has a lot of economic potential"
arg.1.c:0 "The fate of the Congo belongs to the Congolese!"
arg.2.t:0 "The Congo Purchase"
arg.2.desc:0 "The Argentine government is approaching us with the once in a lifetime opportunity of purchasing their colony in the Congo. Although they're asking for a stiff price the colony could prove very profitable."
arg.2.a:0 "Deal!"
arg.2.b:0 "We can't spare the money."
arg.3.t:0 "The Congo Sale"
arg.3.desc:0 "Our buyers have agreed to our terms and we are now exchanging the lands for the money."

arg.4.t:0 "The Congo Sale"
arg.4.desc:0 "Our potential buyer has refused our terms for the exchange."
arg.4.a:0 "We'll fine another one."
arg.7.t:0 "Reform the Congo"
arg.7.desc:0 "Now that we chose to keep the colony we'll need to decide what to do with it. The socialists said that they would leave the coalition if we keep the Congo as a colony for resource exploitation and had made the case for the full integration of the Congo as part of the Nation. Although costly, integrating the Congo is the only way to keep the coalition intact."
arg.7.a:0 "The Congo remains a colony"
arg.7.b:0 "We shall strive to extend freedom to the Congo"

#Revolution
arg.5.t:0 "The Fate of the King"
arg.5.desc:0 "The King has been in our power since we seized the government back in December. It is time to make a decision of what to do with him. Although exiling him might leave the more radical members of our government dissasfied, it could secure a more stable country. Another option is to keep him captive in the Martín García Island but that will make his supporters weary. The last option is to execute the King for his crimes against the people, while just, this road may lead to unrest."
arg.5.a:0 "Exile him."
arg.5.b:0 "He stays our prisoner."
arg.5.c:0 "Execute him!"
arg.6.t:0 "Trials of the PAN"
arg.6.desc:0 "The PAN, along with our now allies the UCRM, were the parties that the King approached when he formed his emergency government back in November.

Again, harsher punishments may prove popular in the short run, but lenient ruling could build a stronger Nation."
arg.6.a:0 "Let them be."
arg.6.b:0 "Punish close collaborators."
arg.6.c:0 "Lapdogs of the King, the lot of them!" # Laptops, all of them

#Republican Constitution

arg.17.t:0 "The Argentine Constitutional Assembly of 1936"

arg.17.a:0 "for the Argentine Nation."
arg.21.t:0 "Government System?"
arg.21.desc:0 "The first order of business is to determine how the government should be run. Some are arguing in favor of a presidential system, which merges the heads of government and state into one office separated from the legislative branch. Others are making the case for a parliamentary system, where the President remains mostly a ceremonial role and the job of creating and running the government falls under the legislative branch. On the third camp you have people offering a middle point, a semi-presidential system, where you would a President that is more than a ceremonial role but you would also have a Prime Minister."
arg.21.a:0 "Presidential System"
arg.21.b:0 "Parliamentary System"
arg.21.c:0 "Semi-Presidential System"
arg.22.t:0 "Presidential Terms"
arg.22.desc:0 "The Assembly is now discussing the matter of presidential terms. Some people are arguing for four year terms with the possibility of a reelection, stating that shorter terms amplify the ability of the people to oversee the office. On the other camp we have a group favoring six year terms, defending it on the grounds that longer terms bring more stability since the government has more time to implement. Going for four year terms would mean that legislative elections would be held every two years while six year would leave you legislative election every three years."
arg.22.a:0 "Four year terms, with reelection"
arg.22.b:0 "Six year terms, with no reelection"
